# Processed styles appear here

When developing apps using preprocessors like Sass, you NEVER want to commit your processed code to the version control.

For the purposes of this example, I needed to include the folder structure, but there is no CSS file committed to the repo.

To generate the CSS from the Sass, run `grunt` from the CLI.
